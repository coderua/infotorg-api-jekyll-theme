In the current property market, it is increasingly important to have easy access to correct and updated information. There are 83 000 houses and apartments sold each year, and 5 700 documents are judicially registered every day.

We have distributed property data since 1990 and update our data with changes from Statens Kartverk every few seconds. So, when you are ready to automate and digitalize your processes, we are prepared to provide you the data where and when you need it.

“We get our property information from the Property Registry. Then we can see what properties and encumbrances (heftelser) they have. We get an assembly of data from multiple registers, sorted by person or company. It saves us a lot of time.” - Nina Andersen, System Owner at Handelsbanken.

<p>Take the first step to give your company and customers an easier process for data collection by connecting to the API today. We can’t wait to see what you build!</p>

<h2>What can you find the Property Registry?</h2>
### Property information

In this API, you will find all the information you need to make correct decisions when buying, selling, developing, and managing properties.

It contains all judicial, technical, and economic information for all properties in Norway.

### Property Registry

The Property Registry contains information from both the Land Registry (grunnbok) and cadastre (matrikkel). The land registration is a public register which contains officially registered liens (tinglyste rettigheter) and encumbrance on real estate and condominium units (borettslagsandeler). The cadastre is Norway’s official registry for properties.

Among other things, you will get up-to-date information about:

- Encumbrance
- Titleholder (hjemmel)
- Base data (grunndata)
- Holding agreement (festeavtale)
- Property data
- Addresses
- House and building information


### Property Value Report

The Property Value Report is the most efficient tool when you are looking for the value of a property. It uses the SSB price index for the property type and geographical area as a foundation for the value estimation.
