## What is a Jekyll theme?

If you build a Jekyll site, you'll typically use a theme to style your site or at least give a base which you and customize on top of.

A theme is a way of packaging layout files, CSS styling and includes files to be installed in another Jekyll project. A theme might be made from scratch or based on a static HTML. A theme is a great way of making styling reusable across projects by you and other people.

A good example of a theme is Minima, which is the default theme used when running `jekyll new PATH`.
